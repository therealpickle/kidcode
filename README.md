# KidCode

A kid-friendly web app that wraps the [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) to let kids build things with AI through a chat interface. Think of it as Claude Desktop for kids — type what you want to build, and watch it come to life in a split-view preview.

> [!WARNING]
> **Intended for local use only.** KidCode runs Claude Code with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, meaning Claude can read, write, and execute anything on the host without confirmation. Do not expose this to the internet. Consider running it inside a sandbox, VM, or container.

## How it works

KidCode is a Next.js app with a three-panel layout:

- **Sidebar** — project list with create/delete (deleted projects are archived, not destroyed)
- **Chat** — conversation with Claude, streamed in real-time
- **Preview** — live iframe showing whatever Claude builds (HTML games, tools, pages)
- **Undo** — every iteration snapshots project files, so kids can undo mistakes with one click

When you send a message, KidCode spawns `claude -p` as a child process in the project's subdirectory. Claude's streaming JSON output is parsed and forwarded to the browser via Server-Sent Events. When Claude creates or edits HTML files, the preview pane automatically opens and refreshes.

Each project gets a UUID and its own directory under `public/projects/`. Files Claude creates (HTML, CSS, JS, images) are served via an API route and rendered in the iframe.

A hardcoded system prompt keeps everything G-rated and kid-friendly, and instructs Claude to build things as self-contained HTML files.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and authenticated (uses your Claude Max subscription — no API key needed)

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. Click **Start a New Project**
2. Type what you want to build (e.g. "make me a tic tac toe game") — or hold **Space** to talk
3. Watch Claude think and build in real-time
4. The preview pane opens automatically when Claude creates an HTML file
5. Ask for changes ("make the colors purple") and the preview updates
6. Claude reads its responses aloud — adjust speed with the **Reading Speed** slider

### Voice controls

- **Hold Space** (or hold the mic button) to record — release to send
- **Escape** stops playback mid-sentence
- The send button turns into a red stop icon while Claude is processing — click it to cancel
- Reading speed (0.5×–2.0×) is saved in `localStorage` per browser

## Tech stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4
- shadcn/ui
- Lato font (self-hosted via fontsource)

## Content safety

KidCode includes a hardcoded system prompt that instructs Claude to keep all interactions G-rated. The default prompt is in `src/lib/constants.ts`:

```
You are a helpful, friendly assistant helping a 10-year-old learn, explore, and build things.
You answer questions, build tools, games, and applications.

When building web apps, games, or visual projects, create them as HTML files in the current directory.
Use index.html as the main entry point. Include all CSS and JavaScript inline in the HTML file
when possible to keep things simple. You can create multiple files if needed.

Make things colorful, fun, and interactive! Add animations and sound effects when appropriate.
Keep explanations simple and encouraging. Use analogies a kid would understand.
Celebrate their ideas and help them learn by building.

If you don't know something, say so honestly and suggest ways to find out together.
NEVER make up facts, statistics, historical events, or scientific claims you aren't sure about.
It's always better to say "I'm not sure" than to guess and get it wrong.

CRITICAL: You must NEVER respond with or generate mature content that would be rated "R" in a movie.
No sexual content, graphic violence, drugs, alcohol, profanity, hate speech, or other
age-inappropriate material. Keep everything G-rated and kid-friendly at all times.
This rule applies to ALL outputs including code, text, images, and any generated files.
```

To customize the prompt, edit the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` export in `src/lib/constants.ts`. The `CRITICAL` content safety block at the end should be kept in any custom prompt.

## How the CLI wrapper works

KidCode spawns Claude Code as a subprocess:

```
claude -p <prompt> \
  --output-format stream-json \
  --dangerously-skip-permissions \
  --verbose \
  --system-prompt <kid-safe prompt> \
  --model sonnet \
  --no-session-persistence \
  --disable-slash-commands
```

The `stream-json` output emits one JSON object per line with types like `assistant` (text + tool use), `result` (final output), and `system` (init/hooks). KidCode parses these to:

- Stream text to the chat UI as it arrives
- Detect tool use (Write, Edit, Bash) and show activity indicators
- Detect file changes and auto-refresh the preview iframe
- Extract a title from the first response to name the project

## Built with
